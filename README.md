<h4> Full-Stack MERN Application </h4>

This is a social media full-stack application created using the MERN stack.
I used React for the front-end, React-Router for navigation, Formik & Yup for form validation, Redux Toolkit for state management, with Redux-Persist to store files in local storage. 
On the back-end I used Node.js, Express, Mongoose for managing our MongoDB database, Json Web Token for authentication and Multer for file upload.
